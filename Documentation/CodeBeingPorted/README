# Introduction
spi.c file is low level driver which communicates to SPI hardware using C.
This file when compiled will generate a library with the name libspi.c
There is one sample application to call library functions from C#, the application
is test.cs.

# To compile the library
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libspi.so spi.c

# To compile the test application
mcs -unsafe test.cs

# To execute the test application
mono test.exe

# Function description

There are total 3 functions in the library right now.
1. spi_init() function which initializes the spi with the given port number
2. spi_read() function which reads the data by sending some commands and prints data on the console. This can be changed if not required
3. spi_write() function which writes the data along with the commands to perform certain operations.
